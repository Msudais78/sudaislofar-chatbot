Modify the existing 'Sudaislofar' Hinglish chatbot application. The goal is to transform the UI from a small, mobile-style window into a larger, more modern, and visually appealing full-page layout similar to ChatGPT. The UI should be beautiful and professional. Additionally, upgrade the chatbot's response mechanism to support rich text formatting (headings, bold text, lists, and line breaks) using HTML for more elegantly designed and readable outputs.

1. UI & Layout Overhaul (Professional & Beautiful)
The current layout is a small, centered chat box. Change this to a full-page, polished application.

Main Layout:

The entire page <body> should have a dark background (e.g., #1a1a1a).

Create a two-column layout: a left sidebar and a main chat area.

Left Sidebar:

Create a dark sidebar (background color: #202123) on the left with a fixed width (e.g., 260px).

Add a "+ New Chat" button at the top, styled with a clean border and a subtle hover effect.

Below the button, add a section for "Chat History" with placeholder items to mimic a real chat application.

Main Chat Area:

This area should take up the rest of the screen's width (calc(100% - 260px)).

Beautiful Header: When the chat is empty, display a beautiful header in the center of this area. This header must include:

A sleek ninja logo. You can use an inline SVG for a sharp, scalable logo.

The chatbot's name, "Sudaislofar", styled in a modern, bold font next to the logo.

Conversation Display: The conversation messages should be centered within this main area in a container with a max-width of around 800px.

Chat Input Form:

The input form should be at the bottom of the main chat area, aligned with the centered conversation container.

Use a textarea for multi-line input. It should have a professional look with a border that glows on focus.

Replace the text-based "Send" button with a stylish icon button (e.g., a paper plane icon).

2. Advanced Response Formatting
The chatbot currently returns plain text. This needs to be upgraded to use proper HTML formatting for beautiful, structured responses.

JavaScript Logic Modification:

The core functions in the JavaScript that generate the bot's response must be changed to return an HTML string, not plain text.

The function that adds the bot's message to the chat window must use the .innerHTML property to render the HTML, instead of .textContent. This is a critical change.

How to Structure Responses:

Headings: For any response that has a title (like "Here is your poetry"), use a heading tag like <h4> or <h5>.

Bold Text: Instead of using asterisks (**Sanam**), the response string must use HTML's <strong>Sanam</strong> tag.

Lists: For responses that contain points, use an unordered list (<ul>) with list items (<li>).

Poetry & Multi-line Text: Each line should be separated by a <br> tag. The entire poem or multi-line text should be wrapped in <p> tags for proper spacing.

Example of an Updated Response:

Instead of this plain text string:
Arey waah, Sanam!... --- **Sanam, Sanam, tera naam hi itna pyaara,** Jaise koi haseen sapna ho hamara. **Teri aankhon mein chamak...** --- Kaisa laga?

The function should return this HTML string:

<h4>Sanam ke liye Poetry</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Sanam, Sanam, tera naam hi itna pyaara,</strong><br>
    Jaise koi haseen sapna ho hamara.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Teri aankhon mein chamak, tere chehre pe noor,</strong><br>
    Har mushkil ho jaye tujhse door.
</p>
<p>
    Kaisa laga Sanam? Maine dil se likha hai! ðŸ˜Š
</p>

Summary of Tasks:
Restructure the HTML and rewrite the CSS to create a beautiful, full-page, two-column layout with a professional aesthetic.

Design a new header for the main chat area that includes a ninja logo and the chatbot's name.

Update the JavaScript response functions to create and return formatted HTML strings.

Modify the message display function in JavaScript to use .innerHTML to correctly render the chatbot's formatted responses.
